# Experiment 1 - Calculare classical dimensions for benchmark circuits. 
A collection of data created by experiments during this research.

In the context of quantum circuits, classical dimensions refer to certain characteristics that describe the structure and complexity of the circuit. These dimensions include depth, size, and width:

- Depth (d): Depth of a quantum circuit refers to the number of sequential operations (quantum gates) that are applied before the final output is obtained. In other words, it measures how "deep" the circuit is in terms of the number of computational steps required to perform a computation. A deeper circuit typically implies a longer sequence of operations and potentially more complex computations. Depth is a crucial parameter in quantum algorithms and quantum error correction, as deeper circuits may require more resources and can be more susceptible to errors.

- Size (s): The size of a quantum circuit refers to the total number of quantum gates used in the circuit. It represents the physical resources, such as the number of qubits and the number of gates, required to implement the computation. The size of a circuit directly affects its computational complexity and resource requirements. Larger circuits may require more qubits and gates, making them more challenging to implement physically and potentially slower to execute.

- Width (w): Width of a quantum circuit refers to the maximum number of qubits that are simultaneously involved in a computation at any given step. It measures the parallelism or concurrency of the computation. A wider circuit implies that more qubits are being processed simultaneously, potentially leading to faster computations and better utilization of quantum resources. However, increasing the width may also introduce challenges in terms of qubit connectivity and gate implementation.

These classical dimensions provide insights into the structure and complexity of quantum circuits and are essential for analyzing the efficiency and scalability of quantum algorithms and implementations. Optimizing these dimensions is a key aspect of quantum algorithm design and quantum computing research.
